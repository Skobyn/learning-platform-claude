### Quick Wins ✅ ALL COMPLETED
1. ✅ Deploy Redis (unblocks full functionality) - DONE
2. ✅ Set up Cloud Build triggers (enables CI/CD) - DONE
3. ✅ Configure domain and SSL (improves trust) - DONE via CDN config
4. ✅ Enable monitoring (prevents issues) - DONE

### Dependencies
- Redis deployment required before scaling
- CI/CD needed before team expansion
- Monitoring required before production launch
- CDN recommended for global users
