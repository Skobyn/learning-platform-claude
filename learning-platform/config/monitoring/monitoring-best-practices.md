# Learning Platform Monitoring Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines the monitoring and observability best practices for the Learning Platform. Following these practices ensures reliable, performant, and maintainable monitoring of our learning management system.

## Monitoring Strategy

### The Four Golden Signals

1. **Latency**: The time it takes to service a request
2. **Traffic**: A measure of how much demand is being placed on your system
3. **Errors**: The rate of requests that fail
4. **Saturation**: How "full" your service is

### Monitoring Levels

#### Infrastructure Monitoring
- **Cloud Run**: CPU, memory, instance count, request latency
- **Database**: Connection count, query performance, deadlocks
- **Cache (Redis)**: Memory usage, hit/miss ratios, connection count
- **Storage**: Disk usage, I/O operations

#### Application Monitoring
- **API Endpoints**: Response times, error rates, throughput
- **User Flows**: Login success rate, course completion rates
- **Business Metrics**: Revenue, user engagement, feature usage
- **Security**: Failed login attempts, suspicious activity

#### User Experience Monitoring
- **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Page load times, user interactions
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: Automated tests of critical user flows
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS metrics

## Alert Management

### Alert Severity Levels

1. **CRITICAL**: Immediate response required (paging)
   - Service completely down
   - Data loss occurring
   - Security breach detected

2. **ERROR**: Urgent attention within 1 hour
   - High error rates (>10%)
   - Significant performance degradation
   - Resource exhaustion imminent

3. **WARNING**: Attention required within 4 hours
   - Elevated error rates (>5%)
   - Performance degradation
   - Resource usage approaching limits

4. **INFO**: No immediate action required
   - Informational events
   - Scheduled maintenance
   - Usage pattern changes

### Alert Design Principles

1. **Actionable**: Every alert should have a clear action
2. **Meaningful**: Alerts should indicate real problems
3. **Contextual**: Include enough information to understand the issue
4. **Escalatable**: Clear escalation paths for different scenarios

### Alert Fatigue Prevention

- Set appropriate thresholds based on historical data
- Use alert grouping and deduplication
- Implement alert dependencies to reduce noise
- Regular review and tuning of alert policies
- Use intelligent alerting (ML-based anomaly detection)

## Dashboard Design

### Executive Dashboard
- High-level business metrics
- SLA compliance status
- Revenue and user growth
- System health summary

### Operations Dashboard
- System performance metrics
- Error rates and types
- Resource utilization
- Recent deployments and their impact

### Development Dashboard
- Code quality metrics
- Deployment frequency and success rate
- Feature usage analytics
- Performance trends by feature

### User Experience Dashboard
- Core Web Vitals
- User journey analytics
- Conversion funnel metrics
- Customer satisfaction scores

## Log Management

### Structured Logging

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "service": "learning-platform",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "user_id": "user123",
  "session_id": "session456",
  "trace_id": "trace789",
  "component": "authentication",
  "event": "login_failed",
  "message": "Invalid password for user",
  "metadata": {
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "login_method": "email"
  }
}
```

### Log Retention Policy

- **Error Logs**: 90 days in hot storage, 2 years in cold storage
- **Audit Logs**: 7 years (compliance requirement)
- **Performance Logs**: 30 days in hot storage, 1 year in cold storage
- **Debug Logs**: 7 days (production), 30 days (staging)

### Log Aggregation Strategy

1. **Real-time Processing**: Critical errors and security events
2. **Batch Processing**: Analytics and reporting
3. **Stream Processing**: Performance metrics and user behavior
4. **Archive Processing**: Compliance and long-term analysis

## Performance Monitoring

### SLA Definitions

| Metric | Target | Measurement Window |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| API Availability | 99.9% | 30 days |
| API Response Time (95th percentile) | < 2 seconds | 30 days |
| Error Rate | < 1% | 30 days |
| Page Load Time | < 3 seconds | 30 days |

### Performance Budgets

- **Critical User Journeys**: < 2 seconds end-to-end
- **Search Results**: < 1 second
- **Course Content Loading**: < 3 seconds
- **Video Streaming Start**: < 5 seconds

### Capacity Planning

1. **Traffic Growth**: Plan for 50% year-over-year growth
2. **Seasonal Patterns**: Account for back-to-school and certification seasons
3. **Feature Rollouts**: Reserve 25% capacity for new features
4. **Disaster Recovery**: Maintain 2x capacity in backup regions

## Security Monitoring

### Security Events to Monitor

1. **Authentication Failures**: Multiple failed login attempts
2. **Authorization Failures**: Access to unauthorized resources
3. **Data Access Patterns**: Unusual data access or exports
4. **Network Anomalies**: Suspicious traffic patterns
5. **Configuration Changes**: Unauthorized system modifications
