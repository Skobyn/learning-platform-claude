# Enterprise Learning Platform Architecture

## Project Structure Created

The following architecture files have been created in the `/home/sbenson/learning-platform` directory:

### Configuration Files
- **package.json** - Dependencies and scripts for Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma
- **next.config.js** - Next.js configuration with security headers, image optimization, and performance settings
- **tsconfig.json** - TypeScript configuration with strict settings and path aliases
- **tailwind.config.ts** - Tailwind CSS configuration with custom design tokens and animations
- **.env.example** - Environment variables template with all required settings

### Database & Schema
- **prisma/schema.prisma** - Complete database schema with all entities:
  - Organizations, Users, Topics, Courses, Modules, Lessons
  - Quizzes, Questions, Enrollments, Progress tracking
  - Badges, Certificates, Notifications, Feedback
  - Activity logs and audit trails

### Core Application Files
- **src/app/layout.tsx** - Root layout with providers, SEO metadata, and responsive structure
- **src/app/providers.tsx** - Client-side providers for NextAuth, React Query, and Theme
- **src/app/globals.css** - Global styles with design system, utility classes, and animations
- **src/types/index.ts** - Comprehensive TypeScript type definitions
- **src/lib/db.ts** - Database connection utilities with caching, transactions, and metrics
- **src/lib/auth.ts** - Authentication utilities with NextAuth, RBAC, and security features

## Key Features Implemented

### Database Architecture
- Multi-tenant organization support
- Hierarchical course structure (Topics → Courses → Modules → Lessons)
- Comprehensive progress tracking and analytics
- Badge and certification system
- Role-based access control (Admin, Instructor, Manager, Learner)
- Activity logging and audit trails

### Authentication & Security
- NextAuth.js with multiple providers (credentials, Google, OAuth)
- JWT token management with session handling
- Role-based permissions system
- Password policies and validation
- Rate limiting and security middleware
- Activity logging and audit trails

### Performance & Scalability
- Database connection pooling and caching
- Query optimization with helper functions
- Batch operations for bulk data processing
- In-memory caching with TTL
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### Development Experience
- TypeScript with strict mode and comprehensive types
- Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- Component library patterns with Radix UI
- Development tools and debugging utilities
- Hot reloading and fast refresh

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with multiple providers
- **State Management**: React Query + Zustand
- **UI Components**: Radix UI + Custom components
- **Deployment**: Containerized with Docker support

### Design Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Database access layer abstraction
- **Provider Pattern**: Context providers for shared state
- **Component Composition**: Reusable UI component patterns
- **Hook Pattern**: Custom hooks for business logic
- **Middleware Pattern**: Authentication and security layers

### Security Considerations
- HTTPS enforcement and security headers
- OWASP Top 10 compliance measures
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

## Database Schema Overview

The database schema supports the complete learning management system requirements:

```
Organizations (Multi-tenant)
├── Users (Admin, Instructor, Manager, Learner)
├── Topics (Subject areas)
│   └── Courses
│       └── Modules (Video, Text, Interactive, Quiz)
│           └── Lessons
│               └── Notes
├── Badges & Certificates
├── Notifications
└── Analytics & Activity Logs
```

### Key Relationships
- **Multi-tenancy**: All data scoped to organizations
- **Hierarchical Content**: Topics → Courses → Modules → Lessons
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed completion and time tracking
- **Assessment System**: Quizzes with multiple question types
- **Certification**: Automated badge and certificate issuance

## API Structure (Planned)

The API follows RESTful conventions with additional GraphQL support:

```
/api/auth/*          - Authentication endpoints
/api/organizations/*  - Organization management
/api/users/*         - User management
/api/courses/*       - Course CRUD operations
/api/progress/*      - Progress tracking
/api/analytics/*     - Reporting and analytics
/api/admin/*         - Administrative functions
```

## Component Architecture (Planned)

```
src/
├── app/              # Next.js App Router pages
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/          # Base UI components
│   ├── forms/       # Form components
│   ├── layouts/     # Layout components
│   └── features/    # Feature-specific components
├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
├── lib/             # Utility libraries
├── types/           # TypeScript type definitions
└── utils/           # Helper functions
```

## Next Steps

To continue development:

1. **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Setup Database**: Configure PostgreSQL and run `npm run db:push`
3. **Environment Setup**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
4. **Start Development**: `npm run dev`
5. **Build Components**: Create UI components following the design system
6. **Implement Features**: Build out the core learning management features

The architecture provides a solid foundation for building the enterprise learning platform with all the requirements from the specifications.
